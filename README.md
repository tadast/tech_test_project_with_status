## Task

Use Ruby on Rails to build a project conversation history. A user should be able to:

- leave a comment
- change the status of the project

The project conversation history should list comments and changes in status.

Please donâ€™t spend any more than 3 hours on this task.

## Brief

Treat this as if this was the only information given to you by a team member, and take the approach you would normally take in order to build the right product for the company.

To this extent:

- Please write down the questions you would have asked your colleagues
- Include answers that you might expect from them
- Then build a project conversation based on the answers to the questions you raised.
